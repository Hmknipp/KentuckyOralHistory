[BLANK_AUDIO] >> Okay Demita, if you would, we already discussed the broad picture here with you. And if you could, let's do our biographical information and just tell us about who your grandparents were, where they came from, how long they've been here, and those kinds of things. As much as you know. >> Okay, both sides of my family's boys grandparents came from Virginia. One group came, my mother's father and mother, or instead father even all came from a place called Bedford, Virginia. And then my father's parents came from basically a place called Chatham, Virginia. >> Okay, and could you give us your grandparents' names? >> Okay, my grandmother on my mother's side was William and Dorothy Wade. And my father's parents were James and Elizabeth Jals. >> How do you spell that? >> G-I-L-E-S. >> Jals. >> Okay, and basically both my parents. >> When did your grandparents live in? >> Because of the coal mining. >> To McDowell County. >> To McDowell County, they came. >> What year did they come? I'll be back. >> I'll guess maybe even the early 30s. >> Okay. >> So they, we basically been here forever. >> Okay. >> And both my grandfathers worked in the mines, coal mines back when it was mues and shoveling and that type of situation. And then my mom and dad both, I don't think my mother was born here, but my father was born in West Virginia and he was a miner. >> What was your father's name? >> His name was James Jals. And as they say to this union, there were 11 children. >> And what was your mother's name? >> Marcella. >> Okay. >> Okay. >> And what were your brothers and sisters name? >> Okay. I have a James, a Dolly, a Allen, a Edgar, a Clinton, a Diana, a Dassa. Myself, Demeter, a Kenton, a Deffie, and a Danette. And we all have nicknames. >> And where do all of these brothers and sisters now live? >> I have two sisters that live in Dallas, Texas. I have a brother that lives in New York. I have another sister that lives in Columbia, South Carolina. I have a brother and a sister in Charleston, West Virginia. Well, I've got another brother. Basically, this will be living in Charleston. And then the rest of us live right here in McDowell County or in gear. >> Okay. And your father, you said he was a coal miner. >> Yes. >> He was in here working the mines. >> Bate, no, he grew up here. His parents moved here. >> Well, he grew up here. And what year did your mother and father get married? >> Okay, let me think. Probably around -- my oldest brother is 50. So we would say back -- they got married maybe back in '44, I guess. >> Early '44. >> Early '44. >> Okay. So they raised their -- what town did they live in? One town in the South Carolina? >> Yes, we live in a -- well called, but in the Newtown section. So it's well called. It was before it became Gary. I mean, it was considered Gary, but each little coal mining community -- >> Had its own name. >> Yes, had its own name. >> So now it's called Gary. >> Gary. >> But it was before Willow. >> Willow. And we still have our individual post office that is Will Park. >> And as -- as -- as just separate and distinct from that great Republican area -- >> Of Gary. That's what I -- that's how it goes, exactly. >> Okay. And so what year were you -- were you born in? >> I was born in 1956, and I'm basically the eighth child. >> Okay. So what was it like growing up in the -- in the '50s and '60s in -- in Wilco, uh, in Oakland? >> Okay. Well, I went to a three-room school for like -- first and second was in one -- >> And it was -- by the time you started school, the schools had already been in English. >> Well, no. >> You were still going to second grade school? >> No, our school, because it was -- each community had their own school. So black and white went together in the elementary school days, basically. >> Uh-huh. >> And then in high school, it was still, you know, separate schools, but some black students did attend the white school. >> Mm-hmm. So which school did you go to? >> In -- up until going into the third grade, I went to the little school in Wilco where we walked to school. And then, uh, when they integrated, it's when I had to attend -- we caught the school bus and went to Maine Geary. It's what they called it. >> Maine Geary? >> Yes. >> And when you went through what grade there? >> To the sixth grade, and then you went up to another school, which was still in Geary for high school, and that was from seventh to 12th grade. >> And you went to high school integration? >> In Geary, yes. >> And what was the name of the high school? >> Geary High School. >> And that's where you graduated? >> Yes. >> Uh, did -- when you went from the segregated schools to the integrated school, which one did you like the best? Did you enjoy -- >> I guess I enjoyed and liked going to the bigger school. >> I like. >> Because there were more things going on. >> More things going on. You never really got to go to Geary, even though it's two miles up the road, it was like going to town almost. So when you went to Geary and you caught the bus, it was like, I guess moving up. >> You felt like you were moved up. >> Moved up. >> So what was it -- those were your school experience. What was it like growing up there? Is Wilco -- is it mostly a black community? >> No. It's black and white. >> Okay. >> But basically, and the section that I live in is basically black, but up the road, which we call Wilco Bottom, was both black. And white in that community. It was fun. Where I lived, it was only a maybe -- I think the houses go up to 14. And they're on both sides of the highway. And on both sides. And you just basically stayed right in there. And there was enough children right there that you didn't need to go up -- say to Geary. >> You know, I was a kid's playboy. >> Yes, it was lots of kids. >> And growing up, you enjoyed growing up in the cold camps. What did you do without? I mean, you had a lot of brothers and sisters. >> Yes. >> And father making good money in. >> You really didn't think about that. I don't think. My mom made our clothes. >> You were not as money-oriented as you are now. >> As you are now. And my dad died when I was in the fifth grade. And it was seven of us still in school. >> What did he die of? >> He had cerebral hemorrhage. And it was something that happened. And within two hours time, he was gone. >> But it wasn't related to the mind. >> No, it wasn't. It was -- right now you would call it an alcoholic. He had that problem. And he had other problems. But basically, when that happened, it was -- >> So you were raised in an alcoholic home. >> Well, I guess you would say now that's what they were labeled. >> That's what it was. >> And it was that your dad -- >> He had a drinking problem. >> -- drinking problem or not even that. It was nothing said, you know. It was just part of life. >> But you were a part of -- you remember about your father. Was he good? >> He was a wonderful dad. I tell people all the time that my dad didn't hear this. But even between my mom and dad, their relationship, it was -- being if he did come home drunk and being, you know, sometimes it was fussing. But basically, it was him fussing and not her responding. It was just him walking in and so walking out. But it wasn't -- we had a -- I think I enjoyed my -- as far as being, you know, like I said, I was in the fifth grade. And we celebrated holidays. And it seemed like he was the one that was -- my mom always said, "Your dad liked Christmas and all those holidays." He was an only child. So that's one of the reasons it was so many of us. He wanted a big family. But he was -- >> Well, he succeeded. >> Yeah, he succeeded with that. And it just so happens. Now, we have 11 grandsons. It's no girl. So in my -- >> Did your mother remarry? >> No. >> My mom never remarry. >> So even though he didn't die in the lines, did his -- did she get a U.S.W.A. >> Yes. >> Because he -- he was -- because he died? >> Yes. It took her about two years. And she knows she didn't get pension. She received black lung benefits and his social security. And my dad had been in the service. So we received VA. And that was, you know, when they gave VA -- >> Was he in the service during World War II? >> During the Korean War. >> Korean. Okay. >> And so you had a -- you had basically -- even though your father was a banker, you had basically -- >> Yes. >> -- your good memories about the last and the happy home life, pretty much. And did you all raise -- did you raise any chickens and pigs? >> We had -- yes. But that was before my time. Thank God. [ Laughter ] But they did. I can't remember us having -- >> In the garden. >> Yes, a garden and pigs. My grandmother, my mom's mother had chickens and that type of things. >> I never liked chickens much. My grandmother used to say, "Go in there." I had to gather the eggs. And I'd go in there and that old hen would be sitting on those eggs. She'd say, "Now, how do they want her to -- she'd just reach out to her and get those eggs. And every time I reached for them, they'd pat me to death." >> No. [ Laughter ] But we did. Basically, you know. My mom was a homemaker for a long time. Eventually, she went out and she worked at a -- like a drive-in or a restaurant. But she basically stayed at home when I was growing up. At one time, when I was smaller, before I started going to school, she went to New York and worked. Because of the mine layoff, so, you know, shutting down four-pile-hour, whatever. >> What year did you guys work in high school? >> 1974. >> Did all your brothers and sisters graduate? >> Yes, every one of us did. >> You know, I keep getting this idea. Where did you get this idea of the illiterate hillbilly when everybody that I've talked to, that I've interviewed in the last 30 days, was, "Yeah, we all know that." [ Laughter ] >> I had one brother that did ask my mom to quit school. And when he did, he went -- he was going to vocational school is what happened. And he caught the bus when he came down past the house that afternoon. So I guess he quit for a morning. And he's the only one that's a schoolteacher. >> Which is funny. >> Which is funny. >> And how many of them went out of college? >> Okay. As far as going to college -- >> Gradually. >> Okay, I have a sister that's a registered nurse. I have a brother, like I said, that's a schoolteacher. I have a sister that went to school and graduated in, like, marketing. But she's an airline student. I have another sister, so that's four. So four. >> How old are you? >> 11. >> So you had a good -- what was it like growing up in your county? You're more or less of my age group, you know, the people that I -- what was it like? Growing up around here in high school. And I guess the Vietnam War was a big thing and everybody was more -- >> To them. >> -- out there people supporting the war or against it or just saw it as something they had to do. >> I think that's what happened. It was something they had to do because -- >> They couldn't get out of? >> Out of five brothers, four of my brothers were drafted and had to go. >> And what did you do? >> No, only one went to Vietnam. I had one brother that was in Texas, one that went to Germany, and my oldest brother was like, went over to Korea. But other than that, you know, they went. So when people say, oh, it's just -- it was a part of their life. They went to service and they made it back. And basically they came back, you know, unharmed, uninjured. >> And not crazy. >> Well, one brother does have some problems. >> The one that went to Vietnam. >> Which basically I think that goes along with being sent over there. It's just something that, you know, basically that happened. >> I got this one. >> Thank you. [ Laughter ] It's just a pam and I grew up in the same community. Family, friends, and all. >> So and still big brothers? >> Still friends. We even worked together. We worked at the same place. >> Well, it says here by your name, Delphiclnick. >> So do you operate a health clinic? >> No, I work out of a health clinic. I'm a counselor. We're called Pernatal Counselors. But then it's basically outreaching, going out and bringing -- we work with maternal and infant health. It's the name of my program. And we work with pregnant women and babies. >> Do you all try to -- do you provide services like birth control? >> We provide any kind of -- we provide birth control services. As for as telling the girls what type of birth control is out there, helping them make choices, bringing them into the clinic. We basically work with pregnant women and babies. And healthy pregnancies and return healthy babies. Getting in for Pernatal Checkup. >> What about those that want abortions? >> No, we don't do that. >> That's not a part of the service? >> No, it's not a part of the service. >> So is this a state of West Virginia program or the Al County program? >> It's basically -- >> Where's Bob? >> No. >> This would just have to keep working. >> It's a tug river type program. But it is -- the state does fund what they call a right from the store program that is basically a concept of our program. >> And you're the girl who's working with young pregnant women? >> The tug river. >> What's the official name of your -- >> Clinic. It's the Tug River Health Association. And we have two locations. >> And your official title -- >> It's a Pernatal Counseling. >> A Pernatal? >> P-E-R-I-N-A-T-A-L. >> Pernatal. >> Yes. I'm a per-professional. And then my job is because of my life experience. I used to babysit. I was a teenage unwit pregnant person one time in my life. I later got married. And let's see what else. I worked in the coal mines. >> You worked in the mines? >> Yes. Basically, they give me four actual years. I was involved in a couple of layoffs. So basically, I've got four actual years. I liked the money. >> How much money were you paying? >> I found a pay state stub the other day for two weeks of pay back then because I worked in white. I started working in '79 in the early '80s. So I -- like, $800, $900 net pay I brought home. >> Clear. >> Clear money. >> For a couple weeks more. >> Yes. So it was good money. >> So you got me every two weeks? >> Every two weeks. >> And then that play -- did you quit doing it just -- >> No, I got laid off. >> You still been doing it? >> Yes. I have a girlfriend that -- we started -- she started like May. I started in November and she still worked and we started in '79. >> And then you got into this paraprofessional program. >> Oh, no, thanks. >> A perinatal counselor. And you go -- >> All over MacDowell County. And basically, we get referrals from girls that come in to the clinic and have positive pregnancy tests. And then we do many things with them as far as, like I said, the counseling, the education. We provide social support and helping them get to doctor's appointments, making and taking them to WIC, which is the Women and Infants Food Program. >> The Similac. >> Yes, the Similac, the SMA, that type thing. >> Are you noticing the increase in teen pregnancies? >> Well, we weren't kind of like a slight decrease a couple of years back, but the last time it's up again. It's just something that I don't understand. I don't know understanding of it because we teach them birth control. We even help them as many types of birth control that's out. And one particular thing that they're doing is what they call noorplants that last for five years. >> I saw that last night. >> What is it? Assisting an attorney surgeon, somebody? >> They're charging $168 for noorplants in the United States and $23 or something like that. What's the difference? >> Preference. >> $350 and then they're charging like $23 somewhere else. And this whole idea, I think they keep talking about healthcare. Quite obviously, the dollar amount is in the drug company profits. That's quite obviously where the dollars are going. If the doctors aren't getting into drug companies, it's just out -- I had a friend that went to Cancun, Mexico, and his son has had this high-liners' disease. So he gets a bonkatis all the time to get this core flex. It's something they get all of this ampicillin stuff. They pay $40 for it every time he gets sick in Crossville. And when they were in Cancun, he got sick. He ran down -- they had a pharmacy in the hotel. You only have to have a prescription. They get the book out, look at that, a chem flex. Look at that, a chem flex. Bought the same prescription. It cost him four bucks. And you would have thought in Cancun, oh, it would be $400 more. And it was incredibly cheap. >> That's it. >> So quite obviously, there's a problem. There needs to be a drug. So you work with -- now I'll get off the editorial plate. So you work with the girls. And one of the methods you use is this -- >> Noir plant. >> And you see that as a good thing? >> I see it as a good thing. But they don't always see it. Because once it's inserted, it can stain your arm for five years, unless you're having some kind of medical problem or -- just basically a medical problem. Or you decide, okay, I decided I want a baby in two years or three years from now, and you have them removed. But girls are having them removed that's not had them a year in their arms. And this one particular case, this girl has four children. So I don't understand why she would want them to be removed right now with no husband, no home, no job. >> Did you ask her? >> Yes, and she just said -- she might want to have another baby. And that's -- I've never -- I've got a son. And it was hard raising a son. One. >> You're good at one. I got two. >> So it's just -- it's just the emotions and the finances and the decisions you have to make with the child. You know, it just drains me. So I couldn't understand why she would want more than -- >> Well, I imagine this girl's on welfare right now. >> Yes, she is. >> Did you ask her, like, why she thinks she should continue with that way of life? >> She did say that she had a boyfriend, a new boyfriend. And that he didn't have any children. And that maybe she might have him a baby. So -- >> So these are the kinds of attitudes? >> Yes. >> And then you have other -- because basically we're not to prevent pregnancies. >> Right. >> Our program is to have healthy pregnancies. >> After they get started. >> Yes, after they get -- >> But at the same time it's not to encourage pregnancy. >> I don't think so. And my program, like I said, involves many things. It's girls that are not just teenagers but older women that have problems with electrical bills or housing or they live in substandard houses, you know, houses. And just being a friend in some cases, you know, if they move here from somewhere else and don't have family and all. >> So are you seeing lots of -- in your job, do you see lots of difficulties and problems around the whole of the years? >> From that, single family homes, that's a lot of things. >> Mostly women with kids or -- >> Yes, just women, basically women with kids. It's just many problems. You know, you can have 10 women and really not all -- the only thing that's 10 having common is no money, you know. That's it. That's the only thing. They just have other problems. >> And so each case is -- even though they're -- other than the fact that they don't have resources, each case is a little different. >> Yes. >> And I think that's a mistake, maybe, that, you know, public cities is they -- in a way it's kind of like racism is looking at a group of people and saying, oh, welfare is like grouping everybody together as one thing. It's when in fact they're different. >> It's different problems. It's different. >> And the father of the team mentioned. So -- >> Or generations of the same thing. You know, your grandmother was on welfare, your mother, and so that's your life. >> How do you see the -- do you try to talk to them about those addictions and try to -- >> Yes. And we have many said stories for people -- people's parents were on welfare. People's parents did not complete school, you know, with dropouts. But these girls go back to school. They get an education. They go on maybe not to college, but to a vocational school or get some kind of training. Now, county, we do have like the GED testing and nursing, LPN, nurse aids, business school, and a lot of appliance do, you know, take that route and do find jobs. >> Yes, and do find jobs. >> What do you see for the future? >> I see what I see right as of today. It looks promising. It's people that's finally coming in. When the coal mines were here, I think people thought that they were going to always be around. And basically, like with me, I was 30 years old before, you know, the coal mines fell out or fell apart. So it was many men that got to retire with the coal mines still, mining coal and things like that. So I -- and when the coal mines were here, they basically did not give MacDowell County back what MacDowell County gave to them. They robbed and they took -- and, you know, I grew up with US Steel mining company was the thing. And US Steel did. They took care of, you know, they took care of their workers and they provided the football fields and they provided the security and until they sold the houses in my community, they kept up the houses. And like one time, I think my mom then paid $18 a month rent in our company. >> Did she eventually buy her house? >> Yes, when they sold, they had the option to buy their house. >> They said a lot of people got it for like $12, $13,000. >> Yes, real cheap. I mean real, real cheap. And that's how it worked. >> That's the same way. >> That's, you know, that's how it worked. And I'm not saying that all -- you know, I think the mining companies did take, you know, as far as like I said, a big thing was our football field. Sports has always been a big thing in our county. You know, it's MacDowell. Okay, and you would still camp out football field, fill up, and now you can see who kept it up because if you go up there and look at the football field, it looks like, oh, I can't believe this happened. But I think the future is not -- I don't think MacDowell County or Gary or all the other little communities are going to have to depend on the people are going to have to start doing for themselves. >> The thing that we heard in all these interviews is that there was a time when the only way to make a living off the land was to raise a little corn silk in the channel. >> Yes. >> Then people were kind of on coal. >> Coal and companies. >> And then there were kind of times where people became dependent on welfare and because they had been dependent and they had changed that dependency. And now we're approaching a time where people are saying, we've got to depend on ourselves and these other things. So that's pretty much what I hear from you. >> Yes, that's exactly because it's people that are on welfare now that their parents and their grandparents were not welfare recipients. They were workers. And now it's no jobs. And it's a sad situation. >> For the future, looking ahead, what do you see happening in MacDowell County, down the road, and the country in general? What's the solution to these teen pregnancies and to the economic downturn? What do you see? >> I think people are now realizing that they're going to have to do something for themselves. And it's not just myself knowing this. It's other people realizing that if we want to see a change and that if we want more, you know, for MacDowell County, or for our whole state, you know, we've got neglected for many years. And I feel now that we're -- that people are becoming a word that their input and their little -- what they feel is a little bit of effort is going to make a difference. It's -- you know, I chose to stay here like before I said, oh, my -- I've got sisters and brothers. Even -- I had one -- a couple of my brothers left here and moved back. >> Where did they go? >> One brother went to Illinois. And then, like I said, another brother, they always went away to work in the summer, like to New York and all. And then they chose to come back here, you know. And I think that I always stayed here. I -- it was just -- after I had my son, it was just -- I felt it was just a better place to raise a child. Which it is, it's wonderful, you know. You can really keep up with them, I feel, and all. And my son is leaving this year. He graduates from my state. So -- >> Let me -- this -- there's one thing that John Lee can analyze. As opposed to other places who would have -- there seems to be a real, general kind of thing to be right for it. Between blacks and whites, everybody seems to get along really well. >> It is. >> There seems to be a lot of -- and we were attributing that to the fact that maybe it has something to do with the idea that why West Virginia came about in the beginning of it, which was that it refused to be slayed as part of the Civil War. And that since everybody kind of came together for the same idea that maybe there's this cultural thing that got carried over that, you know, we're kind of special. We're different. But to me, perfectly, I'm assuming there seems to be this wonderful rapport between everybody here and -- >> It's even going to go on, that's fine. >> It's -- it was -- it is communities where it's basically all white. It's still other communities where it's basically all black. And it's how it is. It's always the section of what I call garing that I live in. >> If you want to cross over -- >> If you want to cross over, it's okay. >> Well, and the other thing too that we had mentioned was that we keep running into an interviewing black folks that have gone to school. They've gotten their high school education and government knowledge. They've been successful. Perhaps one of the reasons is because here in West Virginia, people are able to achieve their dreams. You know, they're able to -- they don't feel repressed or suppressed or whatever. They're able to get to do things and be happy. And as a result of doing those things and being happy, everybody seems to be getting along. I think that has a lot to do with it. >> That's how we work. That was our -- >> That's how -- it's basically -- yes, and it's not just started like now. It's been, like you said, back from years back. It was like basically even during my high school days, it was no prejudice or something. >> So, I like the experience you just -- you talked about that when you went to elementary school. Well, I went here because it was here about a minute on the air. >> That's it. >> And then they ran the bus, so we went over here. >> That's it. >> But it wasn't like it was a, "Oh, you never stayed here and you never loaded." >> No. The first day of school, the only thing that frightened me was going to a larger school, you know. >> And who -- what teacher -- >> What teacher was going to be back. >> -- you were right on the idea. >> So, and -- >> Well, you see for the future then, you feel hopeful? >> I feel hopeful, and I know -- I grew up in a religious family. I'm a Baptist, missionary Baptist faith. >> I know you search a lot of Baptist faith. >> And it's many churches, and if you choose to stay -- >> Different kinds of Baptist, right? >> It's different kinds of Baptist, and basically I trust -- I put all my trust in the Lord first. And I just know that it's -- some things that, no matter what's done, won't be changed, but it's a lot of things that will be changed, and it's basically because of people. You know, it's a lot of organizations after the minds shut down, and things, missions that came in, clothing, missions, and food pantries, that never existed in MacDowell County, even until other people saw what a depressed area this place, MacDowell County, was becoming, and they came in to help. And I'm not saying that we don't help our own, but it took other people coming in, helping us, and showing us other things that we never had to turn to before, you know. Like I said, the missions, clothing missions, I was, what, 30 years old before? You know, Salvation Army was around when you grew up, but basically people didn't have to depend on the Salvation Army, and now are the Red Cross to help. So I think, like I said, it's a bright future for MacDowell County, a new change. It's a lot of older people here that, you know, this is how it was done, but now we've got to stack up and do new ways and look at new ideas. Well, and it certainly seems like women are taking a leading role in that. Wouldn't you attribute that to the fact that so many women are coming into leadership positions? I don't think it's liberation or anything, it's just the way of life, a natural change. And the list of changes has come out. It's all over, it's not just MacDowell County, it's in New York, it's in Washington, it's everybody. You're seeing women's empowerment in MacDowell County as being just a greater extension of changes that are occurring all over the country. All over the country. Okay. Last thing we'll do here is, is your chance, one big statement, something happy about, mad about, mad about, that you want to leave us with, use something I feel this way, I think that way, what was it, one last, something you want? Basically, I feel good and I'm proud to be a West Virginia, the hillbilly, as they call it. It's a wonderful place to live. It's been good to me and my family and, let's say, I have a son, it's going to WVU in the fall. What's your name? He had talked about business, but now he said, I'm going to wait a year, so he's going to, he received a full scholarship. You know, at every school? No, in football sports, but he had the grades and the different things, so they offered it to him last July. He's a wide receiver, and WVU lost three wide receivers this year, so he's got a great chance of, Well, then he could come to Tennessee, we have some wide receivers down there. Well, he had a chance to two lanes in New Orleans, and he said it was just too far from home, because Morgan down the back, If you drive, it's about four and a half hours. Well, well, then.

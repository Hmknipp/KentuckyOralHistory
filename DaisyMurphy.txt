When I was in the hospital and was starting up out, and the nurse was talking to him and everything and trying to keep me steel, and she asked me to tell something that I had done with the kids. And I hadn't follow this for years but my daughter told me later she was one that I slept a breath out of her when she was four she was so they they didn't know how I could remember to tell that. As long as it had been that. And Lee passed it on. I don't know what caused me tell itUnknown Speaker 17:11 Have you got any other stories that you things that you remember growing up with?
